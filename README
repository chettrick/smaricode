smari.lst - List file generated from smari.asm.

smari.hex - Intel hex format file of firmware generated from smari.asm.

=====

The assembler currently used is z80asm v1.6 from Udo Munk's z80pack v1.23.
A fork of the assembler can be found at https://github.com/chettrick/z80asm
Assembling smari.asm on OpenBSD is rather wonderful now that a sane MIT
licensed assembler is available.

flashloader is an Expect program that parses the Intel hex format file
smari.hex and loads the firmware into the smari single board computer
by way of a custom-made programmer.
