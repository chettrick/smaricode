smari
=====

z80 single board computer for assembly language exploration

=====

flashloader - Hex file download program based on Expect and TCL.

smari.asm - Monitor program for the smari.

smari.bat - DOS batch file to run the TASM 3.1 assembler.

=====

The assembler currently used is the Telemark Cross Assembler V3.1 from
http://home.comcast.net/~tasm/
Assembling smari.asm on OpenBSD is a rather convoluted mess at the moment.
DOSBox is used to run tasm31.exe with the batch file smari.bat.
The file tasm80.tab needs to be in the same directory as tasm31.exe.

flashloader is an expect program that parses the Intel hex file smari.hex
and loads it into the smari single board computer through a custom-made
programmer.
