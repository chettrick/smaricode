smari
=====

z80 single board computer for assembly language exploration

=====

smari.asm - Monitor program for the smari.

smari.lst - List file generated from smari.asm.

smari.hex - Intel hex format file of firmware generated from smari.asm.

Makefile - Makefile containing targets for assembling and loading firmware.

README - This file.

=====

The assembler currently used is z80asm v1.6 from Udo Munk's z80pack v1.23.
A fork of the assembler can be found at https://github.com/chettrick/zz80asm
Assembling smari.asm on OpenBSD is rather wonderful now that a sane MIT
licensed assembler is available.

flashloader is an Expect program that parses an Intel hex format file and
loads the firmware into the smari single board computer by way of a
custom-made programmer. It lives at https://github.com/chettrick/flashloader
